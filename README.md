The data set is adapted from the provisional COVID-19 deaths by sex, age, and state data from the CDC website.  
The data set consists of death counts from 52 states and territories during 02/01/2020 and 11/07/2020 as of 11/12/2020, it also provides the proportion of deaths involving influenza, and that involving pneumonia.

  <li>How do sex and age play a role in COVID-19 deaths?</li>
  <li>Do they play a similar role in deaths involving influenza/penumonia?</li>
